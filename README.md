# Quickstart - A Framework for Themes
As the tagline suggests, Quickstart is a Framework for themes. Specifically Tumblr Themes, but it can be applied to anything, really.
Quickstart was born from the need to style elements of a theme quickly and efficiently, not wasting time on things that have been styled
time and time again. 

## Where is it, then?
Quickstart hasn't actually released yet. But it will, in the coming weeks. It's currently in the process of being tested, but once that's
done, it will be up and running here on GitHub! 

Stay tuned for more...
