# Quickstart - A Framework for Themes
As the tagline suggests, Quickstart is a Framework for themes. Specifically Tumblr Themes, but it can be applied to anything, really.
Quickstart was born from the need to style elements of a theme quickly and efficiently, not wasting time on things that have been styled
time and time again. 

## Beta 1.0
Quickstart is currently in beta. It can still be downloaded and used on projects, but keep in mind that there may be some bugs and/or
unpredictable occurences.
