Specifically Tumblr Themes, but it can be applied to anything, really.\r\nQuickstart was born from the need to style elements of a theme quickly and efficiently, not wasting time on things that have been styled\r\ntime and time again. \r\n\r\n## Beta 1.0\r\nQuickstart is currently in beta. It can still be downloaded and used on projects, but keep in mind that there may be some bugs and/or\r\nunpredictable occurences.\r\n",
