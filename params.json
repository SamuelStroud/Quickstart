Specifically Tumblr Themes, but it can be applied to anything, really.\r\nQuickstart was born from the need to style elements of a theme quickly and efficiently, not wasting time on things that have been styled\r\ntime and time again. \r\n\r\n## Where is it, then?\r\nQuickstart hasn't actually released yet. But it will, in the coming weeks. It's currently in the process of being tested, but once that's\r\ndone, it will be up and running here on GitHub! \r\n\r\nStay tuned for more...\r\n",
